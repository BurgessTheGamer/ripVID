## Prerequisites for Development

1. **Node.js** (v16 or higher) - [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)
2. **Rust** (latest stable version) - [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/)
3. **Bun** (optional, for faster package management) - [bun.sh](https://bun.sh/)

## Development Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ripvid.git
   cd ripvid
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or with bun
   bun install
   ```

## Development

```bash
npm run tauri:dev
# or with bun
bun run tauri:dev
```

This will:
- Start the Vite development server
- Launch the Tauri application window
